# Reflection: Target User Segments
## Athletes & Long-Distance Runners

For athletes whose feet endure extreme stress—marathoners, trail runners, soccer players, and dancers—foot health is often the barrier between peak performance and career-ending injuries. Based on research:

# Critical Needs Addressed
## Injury Prevention

73% of runners experience foot/ankle injuries annually. Our system targets the top 4 culprits:

Plantar fasciitis (30% of cases): Alerts for abnormal arch pressure (>250 kPa) and asymmetric temperature (>2.2°C difference) 4

Stress fractures: ML models flag cumulative step impacts exceeding bone recovery thresholds 

Achilles tendinitis: Gait analysis detects overstriding (cadence <160 steps/min) linked to 42% of cases 

Metatarsalgia: Pressure sensors identify forefoot overload (>55% body weight distribution)



## Why This Resonates
As someone who is constantly on her feet, I designed this for athletes who wants to keep their feet in good health. The system translates complex biomechanics into actionable insights:

“Reduce pace by 0.5 m/s for 20 mins to lower Achilles tendon load”

“Replace shoes after 302 miles (current wear: 80% tread depth)”

“Elevated midfoot pressure detected—activate arch-strengthening mode”

By bridging wearable tech and clinical-grade analytics, we empower athletes to train smarter—not just harder—preserving their passion and mobility.
